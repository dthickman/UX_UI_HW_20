          <p class="lead">Case study based on design challenge to redesign a non-profit organization's homepage and website design.
              My team and I completed a redesign of the Sea Turtle Conservancy's website. Redesign included improving the 
              homepage. As well as redesigning the adopt-a-sea turtle process and subsequent webpages.

                      <p>How did you conduct the research? We conducted 4 user interviews. As well as two user surveys. 
                         One survey for understanding users’ experience with nonprofit groups in general, and one to understand their experiences with conservancy groups.</p>
                      <p>How did you develop interview/survey questions (providing topic map can help)? Our user research began with user interviews and two separate surveys. Some of what we wanted to learn was:
                        <ul>
                          <li>What are users’ experience with working with non-profit organizations?</li>
                          <li>What made user’s agree to work with these organizations?</li>
                          <li>How did users feel when working with these non-profit groups?</li>
                          <li>What was the process to donate, volunteer, or adopt?</li>
                        </ul> 
                      </p>
                      <p>What are the key findings you derived from the interview/survey? From user interviews:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Most users have either donated, volunteered, or done both.</li>
                          <li>Most users had not adopted an animal before.</li>
                          <li>Users worked with their organizations because it made them feel good to give back, and benefited their community.</li>
                          <li>Some users had trouble understanding what the purpose of the website was and felt that it took time to get through the information on the homepage.</li>
                        </ul> 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        What other products solve a similar problem? Oceanic Society, Sea Turtle Preservation Society, Navarre Beach Sea Turtle Conservation Society
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        How do they compare/contrast? These organizations are similar in that they provide information on sea turtles and the local population of sea turtles. 
                        They offer different experiences and education opportunities about sea turtles and marine life and how they affect our local environment. 
                        These groups work to preserve local sea turtle populations and bring awareness to them. While educating on the importance of protecting these animals.  
                        The biggest contrast is in the reach of these organizations and the scope of their missions. Oceanic Society looks to preserve and protect all sea life and can operate internationally. 
                        While Sea Turtle Conservancy has both a local and national reach. The other groups are much more local and grassroots organizations.

                      <p>The Problem: The Sea Turtle Conservancy website is not user friendly, does not clearly convey its message. 
                         Neither does it clearly promote donating, adopting, or volunteering with the organization. 
                         Which is causing lower interest in working with and donating to the Sea Turtle Conservancy.</p>
                      <p>The Solution: We believe redesigning the sea turtle conservancy website for people who want to protect sea turtles will achieve easier navigation for those who are turned away by the complexity of the current website.</p>
